Reflection

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
(Answer) I feel I met all the requested requirements.
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
(Answer) No. However I would have loved a bit more time to add some extra stretch goals. Other than css. But it took me a while to get this over the line.
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
(Answer) I got held up with a few issues in the building of this project. The first one was forgetting to tell my server to .use(express.text()); whilst configuring it. Lets just say it wont be a mistake I'll make again! It took me over an hr to pinpoint the issue. There was another typo which set me back also. But glad to have made the mistakes as it took some problem solving to put things right. I feel happy with the submission. I will be coming back to this again to push for some more stretch goals and to strengthen my understanding of everything Ive achieved.
